# temperature_humidity_graph

This project is abandoned.  I am instead using Home Assistant with rtl433 to mqtt bridge to pipe data in as sensors and Home Assistant to graph the values.

I've created a template for generating the MQTT sensors here: https://github.com/mmiller7/hassio_config_fragments/tree/master/RTL_433%20to%20MQTT%20Sensors
